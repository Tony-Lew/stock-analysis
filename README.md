# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The Purpose of this project is to help Steve teach his parents that the stock Daqo's “DQ”might not necessarily be the best stock overtime to put all their money into.
We will deliver a analysis on the performance of that stock along with stocks similar to it, so Steve can show his parents to help them make an informed decision.

## Results
The results I would show Steve are, DQ had a phenomenal 2017 giving out a 199% return on the year with its total daily volume of almost 36 million.

I would also show Steve that DQ had a lower 2018 loosing 63% and its total daily volume tripling. That tells me that the initial inverters made their money and now 
that it showed such a promise everyone like his parents heard about it and unfortunately did not keep up with the hype. I would also show him that the stock ENPH have 
a great 2017 and kept its momentum in 2018 with its total daily volume increasing 3-fold.

## Summery
So, in summery I would tell Steve he was well advise to seek analysis on these stocks to be prepared with facts when talking with his parents. This should help them make a more informed decision on where to place money.
During this Module we started of writing a VBA in a longer drawn out form to teach us just how it will work.

But we also learned how to refactor our VBA code so it will take less computing power and time to accomplish the same task. Also if we need to go any add any further !
data we could on the refactored code much easier then to adjust the original code.
